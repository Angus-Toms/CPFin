# Running examples 
Before you can run the examples, ensure you are in the examples directory. You can do this by running the following from the root directory:
```sh
cd examples
```

To build all examples, run the following:
```sh
make
```

And then run any particular example with:
```sh
make run_{example name}
```
e.g.
```sh
make run_basic
make run_overlays 
make run_plots
...
```
